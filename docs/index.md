## Search  


Each time you visit [icons8.com](http://icons8.com/) you are greeted by the search bar, the main tool to help you find whatever asset you need. By default, it is set to icons, but you can choose any type of asset and start searching.  

<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="348" src="/public/landing.png">
</p>

Just type in a request into the search bar and click the  <img align="center" height="35" src="/public/searchbutton2.png">  button, you will see the search results page with a variety of icons in different styles.


<video autoplay="" muted="" loop="" playsinline="" width="auto" height="auto"><source src="/public/Search2.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>


At the top of the results appear those icons that contain the search word in their name or synonymical words.

<p align="center">
  <img width="900" src="/public/timesearchnew.png">
</p>

<br>
If you want to make search results more precise, you can filter them by styles, types, or designers.
<br>
<br>
<p align="center">
  <img width="900" src="/public/searchgeneralnew.png">
</p>
    
+ **Search by image** will help you find icons similar to the uploaded image. You can try other icons, illustrations and even photos.

<p align="center">
  <img width="600" src="/public/searchbyimage.png">
</p>
    
+ **Styles.** When you find an icon that visually fits your project, this filter will help you pick other icons in the same style, saving your time and eyes.
    
+ **Types.** With this one you can either look for static icons or animated ones.
    
+ **Designers.** Provides an option to choose between icons made by our in-house team or those created by independent authors.
    

**Recolor option** allows you to quickly recolor the results and see if the icons will match your project. It has 5 basic colors for the sake of simplicity, but you can use the [Editor](#editor) for further customization.


<details>
  <summary>Search Tips</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>You will get the best results if you use a single search word instead of multiple words. Shorten your request to make it easier to process.</li>
    <li>If you are not satisfied with the search result, try to use synonyms.</li>
    <li>Don’t add the word “icon” to your search request.</li>
  </ul>

</details>

You can also filter icons by topics. Use **Categories** menu located on the left and choose a topic you need. Clicking on a category will present a tiled preview of it in each style.

<p align="center">
  <img width="900" src="/public/categoriesoverhauled.png">
</p>

  
Take on board that there are three free icon categories: **Logos**, **Popular** and **Characters**. All download options for those icons are available from the get-go but using them still requires attribution.


<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Commercial usage of icons from the Logos and Characters categories should be discussed with the rightful owners of respective trademarks.</p>

### Additional features 

The **preview** area displays how an icon will look in your project. You can switch between light and dark backgrounds by clicking the corresponding buttons in the top-right corner of the menu (Light/Dark).

<p align="center">
  <img width="900" src="/public/previewnew.png">
</p>

If you want to edit an icon, choose either the  <img align="center" height="45" src="/public/editinlunacybutton2.png">  or  <img align="center" height="45" src="/public/editinmegacreatorbutton.png">  button. Mega Creator is good for combining an icon with other elements like text or graphics. Lunacy lets you edit vector icons and change them in any way you want. Note that these options are unavailable for _Animated icons_.

## Collections


Collections let you organize your icons, sort them by projects, recolor and download them in bulk.

You can find all your collections if you click the  <img align="center" height="45" src="/public/collectionsslash.png">  button in the left-side panel when you search for and browse through our icons. Even if you haven’t created a collection yet, you will see the default **Favorites** and **Downloaded** collections in the panel.

<!-- TODO: find and attach correctly -->
<!-- ![](attachments/65657/3571713.png?width=340) -->
You can create a new collection by clicking on the  <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/newcollectioncreatebutton.png">
<!-- TODO: find and attach correctly -->
<!-- ![](attachments/65657/2785283.png?width=442) -->

To add an icon to a collection, hover a cursor over the icon and click  <img align="center" height="25" src="/public/addtocollectionnew.png"> . This sends the icon to an active collection. By default, the **Favorites** collection is active.

You can also add icons simply by dragging it onto the particular collection.

<!-- TODO: find and attach correctly -->
<!-- [collections.mp4](attachments/65657/4030469.mp4) -->

When you click on a particular collection and open it, you will see several options:

<p align="center">
  <img width="900" src="/public/newgeneralcollections.png">
</p>

1.  <img align="center" height="90" src="/public/newaddicon.png">  button allows you to upload your own SVG files to be stored in the collection.
    
2.  <img align="center" height="50" src="/public/newcollectiondown.png"> option lets you export your collection in different formats, neatly packed in an archive file. You can choose from different formats:
    
    * **PNGs** of up to 1600x1600px.
        
    * **Icon fonts** for web designers
        
    * **SVGs**, either as individual files within a ZIP archive, or baked into an SVG sprite.
        
    * **PDFs**
        
3.  <img align="center" height="45" src="/public/colorcollectionbutton.png"> option lets you apply a color to the whole collection. Either pick one from a preset palette or specify a HEX code or RGB value.
    
4.  <img align="center" height="45" src="/public/copylinkbutton.png"> button generates a link to the collection and copies it to your clipboard. When your friend or colleague opens the link, the collection will be automatically cloned to their collection library.
    
5.  <img align="center" height="45" src="/public/collectionactionbutton.png"> button includes two options:<br>
    * **Rename** lets you change the name of a collection to something more personal than Collection 6.<br>
    * **Delete**, well, deletes the active collection. This action is irreversible.<br>

## Editor


Editor is a tool that lets you edit our icons without the use of external software. You can access the Editor by clicking on a particular icon. Editor options are divided into two categories: **Edit** and **Add**.

Let's go over the first category.

* **Color** lets you recolor any static icons present on our website, both monochrome and colored ones. You can choose a color from the preset palette, select it via the color picker or input a HEX-code or RGB value. Here you can also save colors to quickly apply them to other icons.
    
* **Background color** adds a modifiable flat color behind an icon.

* **Padding** lets you change the scale of an icon, making it smaller or bigger.

* **Position** lets you move an icon on the canvas.

* **Rotation** rotates an icon.

**Add** category includes the following options:
 
* **Text** tool is for adding basic text to icons. Includes fonts of Roboto and PT families, toggles for bold and italics, weight slide and a recoloring option.
    
* **Stroke** adds an outline to an icon and it’s subicon if enabled. You can also tweak thickness and color of the outline.

* **Subicon** is a neat feature allowing you to add a smaller icon to the main one, creating a compound image. Overlays come not only in the same style as the selected icon but in other styles as well, so you can keep it consistent or try experimenting. These overlays can be resized or recolored the same way as icons and moved to a different part of the canvas.

* **Square** adds a rectangular background. Has two modes:
    
    * Filled adds a square with a solid color behind an icon, but with possibility to create rounded corners, turning it into a circle.
        
    * Stroke adds a rectangular outline, has corner radius and outline thickness controls.

## Common questions


**Case #1. How do I download multiple icons at once?**  
Hover over each icon and click  <img align="center" height="25" src="/public/addtocollectionnew.png"> . When you are ready to download them, open the [Collections](#collections) tab and press Download button on the right, then select the format, size and color. Done!

**Case #2. Can I recolor an icon?**  
Yes, you can! Clicking on a particular icon will open the [Editor](#editor), where you can enable the recoloring mode. It works both for single-color icons and for fancy colored ones. You also can recolor icons in bulk within the Collections tab.

**Case #3. I couldn’t find an icon I need**

If you haven’t found a suitable icon, or wish it was in a different style, you can submit an [icon request](http://icons8.com/icons/request-icon). When creating a request, please describe how you imagine it and mention what style you want to see it in. We will start working on the request once it reaches 8 likes from the community.

**Case #4. Is it possible to edit your icons?**

Yes, for minor adjustments like color, size, backgrounds and outlines you can use our inbuilt [Editor](#editor). To be able to edit vector paths of an icon, uncheck the **Simplified SVG** option for the SVG format in the download popup.

**Case #5. How do I find an icon in a particular style?**

We have a special filter for that! Just search for an icon you need to get to the search results screen, then click on the _All styles_ button to choose a particular style.
